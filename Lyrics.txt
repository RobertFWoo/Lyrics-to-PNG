The battle belongs
to YHWH!

In heavenly armor,
we enter the land.

The battle belongs
to YHWH!

No weapon that’s
fashioned against
us shall stand.

The battle belongs
to YHWH!

And we sing
glory, honor,

power and strength
to YHWH!

We sing
glory, honor,

power and strength
to YHWH!

When the
shadows of darkness
come in as a flood,

The battle belongs
to YHWH!

He’s raised up
a standard,
yes, there’s power
in his blood,

The battle belongs
to YHWH!

We sing
glory, honor,

power and strength
to YHWH!

We sing
glory, honor,

power and strength
to YHWH!

When your enemies
press in hard
do not fear,

The battle belongs
to YHWH!

Take courage
my brethren,
your redemption
draws near,

The battle belongs
to YHWH!

We sing
glory, honor,

power and strength
to YHWH!

We sing
glory, honor,

power and strength,

power and strength,

power and strength
to YHWH!
